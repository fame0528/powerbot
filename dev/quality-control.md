## Overview

This file tracks ECHO compliance, quality standards adherence, and audit results. Manually maintained to ensure quality gates are met.

## ECHO Compliance Checklist

### Core Standards
- [x] Complete File Reading Law enforced
- [x] DRY Principle with zero duplication tolerance
- [x] Utility-First architecture required
- [x] AAA Quality Standards mandatory
- [x] Auto-Audit System active
- [x] GUARDIAN Protocol v2.1 monitoring enabled

### Workflow Compliance
- [x] Planning phase before coding (PHASE ENFORCEMENT)
- [x] Todo lists for complex features (>1 hour)
- [x] Complete context loading before implementation
- [x] TypeScript verification before completion
- [x] Pattern discovery from existing code

---

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Implementation
- [ ] Requirements clear and documented
- [ ] FID created with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Dependencies identified and verified
- [ ] Legacy features reviewed (if applicable)
- [ ] Patterns discovered from working examples

### During Implementation
- [ ] Files read completely before editing
- [ ] Code reuse verified (no duplication)
- [ ] AAA quality maintained (no pseudo-code)
- [ ] Progress tracking updated real-time
- [ ] Todo list status current

### Post-Implementation
- [ ] TypeScript: 0 errors
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Documentation complete (JSDoc + inline)
- [ ] Tests passing (if applicable)
- [ ] Completion report generated

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: ✅ Enabled
- **Type Safety**: Target 100% (no `any`)
- **Documentation**: Target 100% JSDoc coverage
- **DRY Compliance**: Target 0% duplication

### Process Quality
- **Phase Violations**: Target 0
- **File Reading Compliance**: Target 100%
- **Auto-Audit Accuracy**: Target 100%
- **Pattern Discovery**: Required for all new files

---

## Notes

- Review compliance monthly
- Update quality gates as standards evolve
- Track GUARDIAN detections for pattern analysis
- Archive old audit results quarterly
